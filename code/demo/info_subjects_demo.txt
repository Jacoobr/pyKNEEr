In this demo we use 2 sets of images:
- Reference: It is the subject 9526875, folder 20090817 of OAI dataset. The original dicom folder can be requested at the OAI website
- Subject 1: It is a subject from an in-house dataset (laterality: right)

The reference image is in the folder "reference/newsubject". The folder contains: 
- reference.mha: Intensity image in RAI orientation with origin in (0,0,0)
- reference_f.mha: Mask of femur
- reference_fc.mha: Mask of femoral cartilage

The images of subject 1 are in the folder "original/01", which contains DESS and CubeQuant acquisitions in dicom
